	<h1>Hello, I'm Dylan!</h1>
	<img src="images/me.jpeg" class="img-circle" alt="Me">
	<p>I am a British exchange student at ESSEC Business School in Paris. I love reading, history, and video games. I study International Business with French at Warwick Business School in the United Kingdom.

	<h2>Reading</h2>
	<p>I have always enjoyed reading to pass time, but find myself with much less time to read currently because of assignments and projects. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="card-design">
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>I like history because I find it important to understand how we got to where we are today in order to avoid repeating those same mistakes in the future.
	</p>

<div class="card-design">
	<h2>Video Games</h2>
	<p>Video games were my life growing up. I used to play Mario Kart practically every day when I was younger.
